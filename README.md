## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** for implementing the "Pixel Oracle" web app based on the requirements:

---

### **Project Plan**

#### **1. Define Tasks**
**1.1. HTML Development**  
   - Create the basic structure of the app:  
     - Add a `title` ("Pixel Oracle").  
     - Create a `form` with:  
       - A text input for the user’s question.  
       - A dropdown for selecting the category.  
       - A submit button.  
     - Add a `div` to display the random response.  

**1.2. CSS Styling**  
   - Set the background color to grey (`#808080`).  
   - Use a pixel font (e.g., "Press Start 2P" imported from Google Fonts).  
   - Style the form, input, dropdown, button, and response display to align with the pixel art aesthetic.  

**1.3. JavaScript Logic**  
   - Define an object (`responses`) containing arrays of pre-written responses for each category.  
   - Add an event listener to the form for the `submit` event.  
   - On submission:  
     - Prevent the default form behavior.  
     - Retrieve the selected category and the user’s question.  
     - Select a random response from the corresponding category array.  
     - Display the selected response in the designated `div`.  

---

#### **2. Technical Considerations**
**2.1. HTML**  
   - Use semantic HTML elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<div>`).  
   - Ensure all form fields are `required` to prevent empty submissions.  

**2.2. CSS**  
   - Import the "Press Start 2P" pixel font from Google Fonts.  
   - Use simple, clean styles to maintain the retro pixel art theme.  

**2.3. JavaScript**  
   - Store responses in an object with keys corresponding to the categories.  
   - Use `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to select a random response.  
   - Dynamically update the response `div` with the selected response.  

---

#### **3. Development Steps**
1. **Set Up Project Structure**:  
   - Create `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files.  

2. **Code the HTML Structure**:  
   - Implement the form and response display section.  

3. **Add CSS Styling**:  
   - Apply the pixel font and grey background.  
   - Style the form and response display for consistency.  

4. **Write JavaScript Logic**:  
   - Define the `responses` object.  
   - Add form submission logic to handle random response generation.  

5. **Test the App**:  
   - Verify that the form correctly submits and displays random responses.  
   - Test edge cases (e.g., empty fields).  

6. **Polish and Finalize**:  
   - Ensure the app is responsive and visually consistent.  
   - Validate that all requirements and constraints are met.  

---

#### **4. Timeline**
**Day 1**:  
   - Set up project files.  
   - Complete HTML structure and basic CSS styling.  

**Day 2**:  
   - Implement JavaScript logic.  
   - Test the app for functionality.  

**Day 3**:  
   - Polish the design and responsiveness.  
   - Perform final testing and validation.  

---

#### **5. Deliverables**
1. `index.html`:  
   - Contains the app’s structure and form.  

2. `styles.css`:  
   - Defines the app’s pixel art styling.  

3. `script.js`:  
   - Handles the logic for generating and displaying random responses.  

4. **Source Files**:  
   - Include the "Press Start 2P" font link in the HTML.

This project plan ensures the app is built iteratively, with clear tasks and milestones to guide the development process.
